### Hi, I'm Olha ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Olha. I recently finished the Fullstack developer course, where I gained knowledge about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and also gained invaluable experience working both in a team and individually. I am interested in developing as Fullstack developer, I will be happy to work with you :)

- ðŸ”­ &nbsp;Iâ€™m currently working on something cool :wink:
- ðŸŒ± &nbsp;Iâ€™m currently learning Next.js and WordPress
- ðŸ’¬ &nbsp;Ask me about anything related to Javascript/Typescript/React/Node.js
- âš¡ &nbsp;Fun fact: I love zumba and coding ðŸ’»
